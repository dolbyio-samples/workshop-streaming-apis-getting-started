## Dolby.io Streaming Getting Started Workshop with the WebSDK
Dolby.io Streaming (formerly Millicast) is a one-to-many webRTC streaming solution for ultra low latency live streams that can scale for large audiences. 

This workshop will take you zero-to-hero by teaching you how to set up a WebRTC stream Viewer and a WebRTC stream Publisher.

### Get Started
The workshop can be divided into **2** sections:
1. Building a **Viewer** application that allows the end user to join and view a Dolby.io stream.
2. Building a **Publisher** application that allows content creators to publish a stream that viewers can enjoy with the viewer app.

>The workshop requires a rich text editor pre-installed on your machine.

Both part #1 and part #2 include completed code samples in their respective folders. To use the completed samples you **must add your Dolby.io Streaming API keys** to the app-complete.js file.
